# Hardmore!

**Hardmore** is an "Arcade Minecraft Modpack" that is not supposed to be beaten, but rather tries to test your abilities to survive as long as possible.

Enhanced mobs can see you from almost anywhere and try to reach you no matter how. Improved pathfinding and the ability to break/place blocks makes no place safe.
Each second you survive gives you a points and completing quests gives you multipliers, altough they will put you at risk of loosing the run.


I'm still working on this. Currently only a test/prove of concept alpha is available. Point system doesn't work yet.
It is playable without any problems but it's far from finished.

This pack is on Forge but I will try to update it to Fabric and only Modrinth mods.
